# dcgan-svhn
Deep Convolutional GANs for the Google Streetview SVHN dataset. The code is based on the miniproject of the chapter on GAN of the Udacity Deep Learning course. 

## Content
The notebook implements the following steps
* Load in SVHN data
* Pre-process the data scaling the pixel to a desired range
* Define two adversarial networks, a discriminator and a generator, that utilize convolutional or transpose convolutional layers
* Train the networks and generate new images
## Features
If available, PyTorch trains on GPU.
